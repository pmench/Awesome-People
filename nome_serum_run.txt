Togo was the real hero of the 1925 serum run to Nome.
Togo led Leonhard Seppala's team through temperatures reaching
-40F, sniffed out a path in white out conditions, and led
the team over the perilous Norton Sound ice in a storm.
Running over sea ice is dangerous. It can break up and drop you
into the ocean. A musher running over ice in a storm, as Seppala did,
can't hear the ice breaking up or even see. The musher just has to trust
the lead dog. Togo was the right dog to trust. He got them through, and
Seppala's team delivered the serum to Charlie Olson's dog team, who would then
relay it to Gunnar Kaasan and the famous Balto, who only took the serum the last
55 miles to Nome. Togo's leg of the trip was the longest by 200 miles
and when he was finished, he and another dog escaped to go chase reindeer.
He returned to Nome a week later.
